# fsdocs

Simple, [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) and versioned
file system-based document database for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

The idea is that you can use this simple, single-file module for quick hacks
where installing (and possibly deploying) a full-scale "real" database like CouchDB, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc kills your creativity. Since documents and their different versions are stored as regular JSON files, inspecting and manipulating data while developing is really easy and simple (just remove/edit/add files).

Performance is actually pretty good since the kernel will take care of caching
the most frequently read documents in memory. Also, even though this is ACID and
all, a "put" only implies writing a single file. Atomicity and "crashability" is
acquired through a mix of `link(2)` and `rename(2)` operations.

## Example

    var FSDocs = require('fsdocs').FSDocs
    var docs = new FSDocs('./mydocs')

    docs.put('doc1', {title:"Hello"}, function(err, ok) {
      if (err) throw err
      console.log(ok? 'stored ok' : 'conflict')
      docs.get('doc1', function(err, document) {
        if (err) throw err
        console.log(document)
      })
    })

Output:

    stored ok
    { title: 'Hello', _version: 1 }

## API

### new FSDocs(location) -> [object FSDocs]

A document store based in directory at `location`

#### docs.get(key, [version], [callback(err, document)])

Retrieve a document. If `version` is omitted or less than 1, the most
recent version of the document is returned.

If the document does not exist, returns null for both document and error.
If there is another reason why the document cannot be retrieved,
such as permissions denying access, that error is returned.

#### docs.getSync(key, [version]) -> document

Synchronous version of `docs.get`.

If the document does not exist, returns null. Other errors are thrown
as exceptions.

#### docs.put(key, document, [callback(err, storedOk)])

Create or update a document. If `document` does not contain a `_version`
member or its `_version` member is less than 1, the document is
considered as "new" and thus if there's already an existing version an
error will be returned (since the document is effectively version 1). If
there's a conflict when writing the new version, `storedOk` will be a
false value. In this case it's up to the client to proceed (e.g. merge,
discard, retry, etc). `document` must be an object.

#### docs.putSync(key, document) -> storedOk

Synchronous version of `docs.put`


## Implementation

When writing a new document version to the database, fsdocs takes a rather simplistic approach in order to achieve [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)-ness:

1. The new document is written to a temporary file. If this operation fails, we remove the temporary file and bail with an error.

2. A (hard) link is created at "key/lock" (unique to the document key, not considering version). If this operation fails, another version is already being written which indicates a conflict and thus we bail with an error.

3. A new link is created for the document data "key/version.json". If this operation fails, the document has already been modified (version exists) and thus we bail with an error.

4. Finally the temporary link is renamed to "key/current.json". Because of the success of 2. and 3. we are guaranteed to upgrade the document to its latest version. We also retain atomicity because of the implementation of rename(), making concurrent reads of the "current" version safe.

We remove the "key/lock" file (unless 2. fails) when done with 3 or 4.

Most file systems are in fact highly optimized "key-value stores", in a way.


## Known issues

- If the program crashes during writing a document the lockfile might not get
  cleaned up, thus causing that document to become read-only (since any put
  operation will fail to acquire the lockfile). In cases where there's only one
  process manipulating the documents (or more specifically; only one process
  manipulating a given key), this could be solved by simply adding the PID as
  a suffix of the lockfile.
